<INSTRUCTIONS>
## Repo-specific workflow notes (uns-kit)
- Do not run any pull-request / deploy workflows from Codex for this repo unless explicitly asked.
- Default deliverable for PR-related work here is a clear, ready-to-use git commit message (and the code changes), not opening a PR.
- Hosting: `uns-kit` is on GitHub. Other UNS projects may still live on Azure DevOps, so avoid assuming Azure DevOps PR tooling applies here.
